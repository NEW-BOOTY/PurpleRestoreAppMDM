/*
 * The code is a comprehensive implementation for managing devices via Mobile Device Management (MDM)
 * using Apple Push Notification Service (APNs). It is structured to ensure high error handling, modularity,
 * and multitasking, and it leverages concurrent execution and modern Java practices.
 *
 * Features:
 *
 * Configuration Management:
 * - Uses config.properties for storing APNs-related configurations.
 * - Allows overriding configuration via environment variables.
 *
 * Logging:
 * - Utilizes Java's logging framework with ConsoleHandler and FileHandler for detailed error reporting.
 *
 * Device Management:
 * - Detects and manages devices (with placeholder logic for detection).
 * - Sends commands via APNs using the pushy library.
 *
 * HTTP Server:
 * - Includes a lightweight HTTP server to provide feedback about command execution history.
 *
 * Retry Mechanism:
 * - Implements a robust retry logic for sending APNs commands, with a limit of retries to prevent infinite loops.
 *
 * Concurrency:
 * - Uses a thread pool to manage parallel execution of tasks, enhancing efficiency.
 *
 * Command Handling:
 * - Loads and parses JSON-formatted commands.
 * - Sends commands to devices using APNs.
 *
 * Error Handling:
 * - Provides centralized fatal error handling (handleFatalError) for critical failures.
 *
 * Placeholder for Jailbreaking:
 * - Includes methods to simulate jailbreaking logic. It is noted as placeholder logic that should be
 *   implemented ethically and legally.
 *
 * Comments:
 * - Ethical Compliance: Ensure adherence to ethical and legal guidelines while handling sensitive operations
 *   such as MDM commands and jailbreaking.
 * - Enhancements:
 *   - Consider adding more robust validations for configuration and command inputs.
 *   - Secure sensitive data like AUTH_KEY_PATH and device tokens using encryption or secure storage mechanisms.
